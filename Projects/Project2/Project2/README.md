# Artist Statement

This is 'A millennial's survival guide'. Based on the 'Impossible quiz' game's principles, the game asks tricky questions
about how a millennial can 'survive' in this world. This is meant to critique how the current climate (economical, political, social, ...)
has basically set us to fail from the start. It is also a way to get a laugh at the stereotypical jokes that are made by older generations towards us as well as some good old
self-deprecating humor, because we are really good at that.

The goal of this game is not to bring pity or provoke after thought about the subject, but rather to relate and get a laugh at how much life can be hard sometimes,
and that it is not entirely our fault. We are really just trying to do our best with what was handed to us.

My questions were all on theme, but I would have liked to make it more obvious as to why exactly, by making snarky comments when the user gets it wrong. I would have also liked being able to create
more levels and bring more complexity into them. Nevertheless, 'A millennial's survival guide' allowed me to create a diverse range of codes and use a number of different functions from both p5 and p5 sound library
by implementing very different levels that do not have to have something in common other than picturing humorously the life of a millennial.

I consider this a work in progress and a second prototype. My goal is to eventually complete this game, or keep going as long as I am not bored with it.
