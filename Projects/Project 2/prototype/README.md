# Prototype 'A millennial's guide to survival'

This game is a loose retake on 'the Impossible Quiz' by Slapp-Me-Do first released in 2007.

The idea is to have the player reflect on how millennials were put in an already failing system and that we are all
mostly trying to do our best. We have been in a climate and sustainable crisis for decades and no one seems to care, human rights are being miserably disregarded across the globe, the wealth gap is getting bigger as millennials' hopes of building a stable future slim down. And because Murphy had a bad day, most of us are stuck entering the job market and post-secondary education in lockdown caused my a worldwide pandemic.

Nevertheless, we grew up with the internet, aware of everything there is to know, and not know, around. Our individual
voices can be heard a lot more than those of generations before us, and we are learning to use them unapologetically.

This is why I wanted to create a critique under the form of a multilevel game to reflect on what world we were put in, but also what comes next? What do we do with what was handed to us? (My guess is that won't be answered in the first questions of the quiz)

This survival guide will lead you through problems millennials face, as well as problems older generations imagine we are the cause (apparently, we're killing countless industries from cheap pet food to cable TV). Tasks and questions will be
asked of you to do in order to level up.

Fail to answer correctly, and 1 life will be taken off your total 5 (this feature will be added in the full version, it
has not yet been integrated). Lose all 5 lives, and this will trigger Game Over, and show everyone that you could not
make it as a millennial in the outside world.
