# Project 1

This is my project 01. It is a simulation of someone magically saving the climate crisis by picking up rubbish in their backyard.
By controlling the user with the keyboard arrow, you will be able to navigate through the simulation and catch as many flowing bags (yes yes, just like that Katy Perry song). Beware though, the overconsumption of plastic we are perpetuating makes rubbish appear after a while. You'll need to pick all of them up in order to save the planet from the climate crisis. Refrain from doing so and the green gas emission might increase to much and render the earth uninhabitable.
